Hi, I'm Roni 👋

👨‍💻 Hospitality Veteran Turned Developer
After years in the hospitality industry, I decided to take on a new challenge and transition into tech. I’m currently studying coding at Hive Helsinki (42 School), where I'm deep-diving into C and C++.

💡 What I’m Learning & Exploring

I'm still figuring out what area of software development interests me most—right now, I'm focused on building a strong foundation in low-level programming. I enjoy working with others rather than alone and love the idea of creating something meaningful, whether on my own or as part of a team.

🚀 Future Goals

I want to contribute to projects that help others, whether by building useful tools or supporting great ideas. I’ve also thought about launching or joining a startup, as I thrive in dynamic, hands-on environments.

🏀 More About Me

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing basketball, rolling dice in a DnD campaign, watching movies, gaming, or working out. I’ve lived, worked, and studied across Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, which has given me a broad perspective on different industries and cultures.
