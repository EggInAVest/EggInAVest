Hey, I'm Roni 👋

I spent years working in hospitality before switching gears to tech. 
Now I'm studying at Hive Helsinki, learning C and C++ and building solid fundamentals.

**What I'm up to**

Still exploring which area of dev I want to dive into, but I'm really enjoying doing something visual so currently looking into learning more about Webdev and am studying Fullstack open from Helsinki University at the moment.

**Outside of code**

I play basketball and go to the gym, watch movies and play video games. 
I love to travel, usually to a place where it's possible to try and improve my non-existent surfing skills 🏄

Let's connect!
